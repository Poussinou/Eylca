        This application aims at extending your Lumix camera by adding some features it may not have.\n
        For simple remote control, you should probably use the official app instead of this app.\n
        (your camera will be better supported).\n
        Please note that Eylca is an unofficial app, not supported in any way by Panasonic.\n
        \n
        This application allows you to take pictures or record a video when a motion is detected.\n
        The first thing to do is to connect the phone to the wifi provided by the camera BEFORE launching the app.\n
        Then, if nothing appears, go to the settings and try to change the ip address to the ip address of your camera.\n
        If however you see what the camera sees, then it is perfect !
        \n\n
        This application is open-source, released under GPLv3. You can see the code on https://github.com/mbmb5/Eylca
